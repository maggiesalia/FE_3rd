            Animals was a new beginning for <span>Pink Floyd</span> and the
            beginning of the end. After this, the band, in its most well-known
            quartet format, would never officially exist again. Animals is the
            album many diehard fans proudly proclaim as their favorite, that
            contains none of the “money cuts” (pun intended) you grew up hearing
            on the radio, back when radio was still a thing. It’s the album that
            keyboardist/singer Richard Wright hates, for which guitarist/singer
            David Gilmour often equivocates and
            bassist/singer/principal-songwriter Roger Waters passionately
            advocates.

          It doesn’t take a psychology degree to see how or why each party
          (diehards, casuals, individual band members) might arrive at their
          take. Your feelings on Animals likely depends on your respective
          stake. For Waters, it was the first time he became the lone songwriter
          on a Pink Floyd album, save a sole co-writing credit from Gilmour on
          “Dogs,” springing from an unfinished song originally titled “You’ve
          Got To Be Crazy” from the Wish You Were Here sessions.
          <br />

          <br />
          Animals is precisely 41 minutes, 41 seconds long. Yet it’s intense
          enough to feel like 82 by the time it’s through. Animals is a concept
          album that lists five animal-titled tracks, but it’s done a disservice
          if experienced as anything other than one long song. If you start or
          end anywhere but the two parts of “Pigs On The Wing,” without
          listening in order to everything in between? You’re doing it wrong.
          <br />

          <br />
          Pink Floyd had seen leadership and lineup shifts dating back to the
          acid-aided breakdown of former leading man Syd Barrett. Barrett was
          the band’s transmission during their early ascent, playing underground
          rock clubs in swinging London during 1966 before signing their record
          deal in 1967, with Barrett penning almost all the material on their
          acclaimed debut, Piper at the Gates of Dawn. However, within months of
          that initial success, Barrett’s regular LSD use combined with
          undiagnosed mental illness resulted in him being, according to
          bandmate Nick Mason, “completely detached from everything going on.”
          <br />

          <br />
          Animals arrived either directly on the heels, or right smack dab in
          the middle, of Pink Floyd’s critical and commercial apex. It depends
          on who you ask. 1975’s Wish You Were Here, replete with its bookending
          song-suite salute to Barrett “Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I-V
          and VI-IX),” sold twenty million records worldwide. And even that was
          still considered a drop-off, critically and commercially, to the work
          that preceded it: 1973’s <span>The Dark Side of the Moon</span>, one of the most
          acclaimed and highest-selling albums of all-time, which to date has
          sold forty-five.
